** intro **

 A computer keyboard is a external hardware device. Which is typewriter-style device that uses an arrangement of buttons 
 or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape,
 interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input method for computers.


** connections **

There are several ways of connecting a keyboard to a system unit (more precisely, to its keyboard controller) using cables,
including the standard AT connector commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the PS/2 and the USB 
connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary Apple Desktop Bus for its keyboard connector.

** Wireless **

Wireless keyboards have become popular. A wireless keyboard must have a transmitter built in, and a receiver connected 
to the computer's keyboard port. It communicates either by radio frequency (RF) or infrared (IR) signals. 
A wireless keyboard may use industry standard Bluetooth radio communication, in which case the receiver may be built into the computer. Wireless keyboards need batteries for power, and may be at risk of data eavesdropping. 
The 1984 Apricot Portable is an early example of an IR keyboard.
