** Intro **

Alternatively referred to as an audio output device or audio card. A sound card is an expansion card 
or IC for producing sound on a computer that can be heard through speakers or headphones. 
The computer does not need a sound device to function, they are included on every machine to generate sound.


** Connection **

Sound card can be connected either in an expansion slot or built into the motherboard (onboard). As sound output 
is a neccessary thing, sound card is usually built into modern motherboards.
Sound card has some audio ports and audio jacks at the back of it to connect speakers, microphones, MIDI etc.
