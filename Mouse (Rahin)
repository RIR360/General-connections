** intro **

Computer mouse (plural mice or mouses) is known as a computer hardware. It is the external hardware which 
works as a pointer(user interface pointer).A computer mouse is a hand-held pointing device that detects 
two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a 
pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer. A 
mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). 
The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic 
signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.  


** Connections **

1. The industry-standard USB (Universal Serial Bus) protocol and its connector have become widely used for mice; 
it is among the most popular types.
2. Wireless mice transmit data via infrared radiation (see IrDA) or radio (including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi). 
The receiver is connected to the computer through a serial or USB port, or can be built in (as is sometimes the case 
with Bluetooth and WiFi). Modern non-Bluetooth and non-WiFi wireless mice use USB receivers. Some of these can be 
stored inside the mouse for safe transport while not in use, while other, newer mice use newer "nano" receivers, 
designed to be small enough to remain plugged into a laptop during transport, while still being large enough to easily remove.
