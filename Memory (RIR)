RAM or Random Access Memory which is alternatively reffered as main/primary/system memory 
is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer.
Unlike Hard-drive or CD-rom RAM access information randomly instead of sequentially. That's why RAM is 
so much faster. 
RAM is a volatile memory that requires power to keep the data accessible. If computer is turned off all
inside the memory is lost.
