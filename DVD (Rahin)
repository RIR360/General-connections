*Intro*
A DVD/CD drive or optical disc drive(ODD) is an internal computer hardware. An optical disc drive  is a disc
drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of 
the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs.

*Connections*

Most internal drives for personal computers, servers, and workstations are designed to fit in a standard 5.25"
drive bay and connect to their host via an ATA or SATA interface. Additionally, there may be digital and analog
outputs for audio. The outputs may be connected via a header cable to the sound card or the motherboard. At one
time, computer software resembling CD players controlled playback of the CD. Today the information is extracted
from the disc as data, to be played back or converted to other file formats.

It can also be connected by a USB connector with a computer. For that we need a portable DVD drive.
