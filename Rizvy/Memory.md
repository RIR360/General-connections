# Intro

RAM or Random Access Memory which is alternatively reffered as main/primary/system memory. RAM works in conjunction with the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU chip retrieves data from the RAM. Unlike Hard-drive or CD-rom RAM access information randomly instead of sequentially. That's why RAM is so much faster. RAM is a volatile memory that requires power to keep the data accessible. If computer is turned off all inside the memory is lost.


# Connection

RAM is placed on the memory slot or ram slot. Most motherboards have two to four memory slots, which determine the type of RAM used with the computer. The most common types of RAM are SDRAM and DDR(Double Data Rate) for desktop computers and SODIMM for laptop computers.

# Connection Slots

RAM slot is usually found near CPU so that, there's less travel distance between them which causes faster data transformation.
