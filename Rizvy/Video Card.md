# Intro
A video card (also called a graphics card, display card) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device (such as a computer monitor). More plainly, it's a piece of hardware inside your computer that processes images and video, some of the tasks normally handled by the CPU. Video cards are used by gamers in place of integrated graphics due to their extra processing power and video ram.

# Connection
A video card expansion slot is where the card connects to the motherboard. The video card was inserted into the AGP expansion slot on the computer motherboard. Today, the most common expansion slot for video cards is PCIe, which replaced AGP and others. And the Video card has some ports like VGA, SVGA, HDMI to send data to the monitor.

# Connection Slot
The PCI Express, or PCIe, is a serial computer expansion bus standard. PCI Express was designed as a high-speed replacement for the aging PCI and AGP standards and is available in different formats. Each lane of PCIe is capable of transfer speeds around 250 MB/s and each slot can be scaled from 1 to 32 lanes.
