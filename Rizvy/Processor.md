# Intro

CPU, alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor is the central processing unit of the computer. The CPU's main function is to take input from a peripheral (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc) or computer program, and interpret what it needs. The CPU then either outputs information to your monitor or performs the peripheral's requested task. CPU fetches instruction from memory and after executing them stores the result back in the memory. 


# Connection

The processor is placed and secured into a compatible CPU socket found on the motherboard. Processors produce heat, so they are covered with a heat sink to keep them cool and running smoothly. If a CPU is connected via a CPU socket, it is not soldered and can be replaced. 
These are more common on desktops than they are on laptops.

# Connection Socket
CPU socket is made up of a series of pins and connects a CPU’s processor to the PC’s motherboard. Modern processor sockets have approximately 1000 contacts or pins
