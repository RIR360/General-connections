** Intro **

A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as a hard drive or HDD) is a non-volatile data storage device. 
It is usually installed internally in a computer, attached directly to the disk controller 
of the computer's motherboard. Modern HDD contains multiple platters, housed inside of an air-sealed casing. 
Data is written to the platters using a magnetic head or actuator. 


** Connection **

Internal hard disks, connected to the motherboard using an 
ATA(Advanced Technology Attachment) or SATA(Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) cable.


** Connector cable **

Short for serial AT attachment, SATA 1.0 is a replacement for the parallel ATA interface used in IBM compatible computers.
SerialATA is capable of delivering approximately 187 MBps of performance to each drive within a disk array. 
The SATA data cable transmits the data between the drive and the motherboard has seven pins.
